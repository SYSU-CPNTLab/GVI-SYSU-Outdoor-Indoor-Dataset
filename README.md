As depicted in Fig. \ref{equip}, our multi-sensor data acquisition device is versatile and can be utilized for both vehicle-mounted and handheld applications. The device integrates a variety of sensors, including a stereo camera and IMU from Realsense D455, two U-blox ZED-F9P modules from VRTK2 for RTK positioning information, and a smartphone for pressure sensor (barometer) measurements. All sensor data are synchronized using timestamps. We have collected five datasets in a variety of complex indoor-outdoor scenarios, encompassing outdoor environments, underground locations, and building interiors.
